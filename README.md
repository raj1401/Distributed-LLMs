# Distributed-LLMs
This is the parent repository of my project on distributed training and deployment of LLMs I did as part of *CS 441: Engineering Distributed Objects for Cloud Computing* at the **University of Illinois Chicago** in Fall 2024. Below you'll find (*coming soon*) a short description of each component of my project and a link to each repository.
